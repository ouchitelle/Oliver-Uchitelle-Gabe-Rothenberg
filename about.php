            <p>I am a die hard Celtics fan. Over the last few years, this team has had its ups and downs. It seems like year after year I find myself more and more optimistic at the chance of the Celtics winning the finals, and year after year I am let down in some way or another. And although there's irony in this, I think this is finally the team's year to win it all. There is no other team in the entire league that I can see beating the superteam Celtics in 7 games. There is simply no matchup for our star-studded roster. After destroying the Miami Heat in a blowout game 5, the Celtics now look to take on the Cleveland Cavaliers. Although I am a fan of Donovan Mitchell, I don't see him taking down the Celtics on his own. Anticipating a clean sweep against Cleveland, Boston should be rolling into the Eastern Conference Finals with plenty of momentum. Once steamrolling the winner of the Knicks/Pacers series, they will (hopefully) have made it to the final step: win it all. If there's ever been a time for the Celtics to win, it's now - and I'm not too worried.

        <h3>Knicks vs. 76ers</h3>
            <p> Currently the Knicks lead the 76ers 3-2. The Knicks lost in brutal fashion in game 5, letting a lead slip in the last minute of regulation, resulting in an eventual overtime loss. Jalen Brunson who began the series slow followed up with a historic 47 point game. When Brunson was struggling, his former college teammates Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo stepped up. The series is headed back to Philadelphia for game 6 with the momentum very much in the 76ers favor, however, the Knicks are the better team. If both teams were to play their best, the Knicks are the favorite. Playing to the teams best is not often a reality however, especially as the away team. The knicks hope to steal game 6 on the road but if they lose, they'll have home court advantage in game 7 at Madison Square Garden.
