        <h2>Round 1 Spotlight</h2>
        <h3>Nuggets vs. Lakers</h3>
            <p>The Los Angeles Lakers recently lost to the Denver Nuggets. The Nuggets are coming off a champtionship and are looking to repeat. The Lakers won in 2020, but have not managed to have similar success in recent year. The Lakers are led by superstars Lebron James and Anthony Davis, both who have had amazing careers in the NBA, but the Nuggets dynamic duo of Nikola Jokic (soon to be 3 time MVP), and Jamal Murray (one of the most clutch playoff performers in NBA history) was too much for the aging Lakers stars and weak roll players. </p>
            
            <h3>Timberwolves vs. Suns</h3>
            <p>The Phoenix Suns were overpowered by the Timberwolves in the first round of the playoffs. The Suns core of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Bradly Beal was not enough to get past the height of Karl Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert, and the young superstar Anthony Edwards. The Timberwolves are looking to make a name for themselves as contenders, and beating a Suns team that was in the finals only a couple years ago is a step in the right direction. Next, they face the former champions, and the MVP. Will KAT and Gobert be enough to stop Jokic?
